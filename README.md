## Description 📄

In this lab, we focus on **JavaScript destructuring**, a powerful feature introduced with ES6. Destructuring simplifies code by allowing direct assignment of values from arrays and properties from objects to variables. This approach enhances code readability, reduces repetition, and provides a concise way to manage complex or nested data structures.

### Key Concepts Covered:
- **Array and Object Destructuring**: Unpack values directly into variables.
- **Nested Destructuring**: Extract values from deeply nested arrays or objects.
- **Default Values**: Provide fallback values for undefined properties.

### By the end of this lab, you will:
- Understand and apply array and object destructuring.
- Work with nested destructuring for complex data.
- Use default values to handle missing or undefined data safely.

## Expected Project Structure 🏗️

Your project should be structured as follows:

```plaintext
destructuring-practice/
├── index.js
└── README.md
```

##

## 1. **Create the Project Folder and Files**

- [ ] Create a project folder named `destructuring-practice` to store your project files.
- [ ] Inside the `destructuring-practice` folder, create a `index.js` file. This will be your main JavaScript file where all your code will be written.

##

## 2. **Array Destructuring with Default Values**

Let's start with array destructuring and see how to assign default values. Follow these steps to observe how default values work when the array has fewer items than expected.

- [ ] Add the following code to `index.js` to destructure values from an array with a default:

```javascript
// Array Destructuring with Defaults
const numbers = [5, 10];
const [a = 0, b = 0, c = 0] = numbers;
console.log(a, b, c); // Output: 5 10 0 (c has default value)
```

- [ ] Run your code using Node.js in the terminal:

```bash
node index.js
```

### Expected Output:

```bash
5 10 0
```

### Explanation

In this step, we demonstrated how array destructuring works with default values and observed the output:

**Destructuring with Fewer Elements**:  
   - The `numbers` array contains only two elements (`5` and `10`), but we destructured it into three variables: `a`, `b`, and `c`.
   - Since `c` does not have a corresponding value in `numbers`, it uses the provided default value, `0`.

**Why the Output Shows `5 10 0`**:  
   - The first two values in the `numbers` array (`5` and `10`) are assigned to `a` and `b`, respectively.
   - Because `numbers` lacks a third element, `c` takes on the default value of `0`.

This example demonstrates how default values in destructuring prevent variables from being `undefined` when there aren’t enough elements in an array. This is particularly useful in cases where you want a fallback value if the array does not have all expected elements.

##

## 3. **Object Destructuring with Renaming and Default Values**

In this step, we’ll use **object destructuring** to extract properties from an object and set a default value for properties that may be missing.

- [ ] Add the following code to `index.js` to see how destructuring with default values works with objects:

```javascript
// Object Destructuring with Renaming and Default Values
const user = { name: "Alice", age: 30 };
const { name, age, location = "Unknown" } = user;
console.log(`${name} is ${age} years old and lives in ${location}`);
// Expected Output: "Alice is 30 years old and lives in Unknown"
```

- [ ] Run your code using Node.js in the terminal:

```bash
node index.js
```

### Expected Output:

```bash
Alice is 30 years old and lives in Unknown
```

### Explanation

This step demonstrates how to use default values with object destructuring to handle potentially missing properties.

**Setting Default Values for Missing Properties**:  
   - The `user` object contains only two properties: `name` and `age`. There is no `location` property defined.
   - In the destructuring assignment, we specify `location = "Unknown"`, which means `location` will default to `"Unknown"` if it does not exist in the object.

**Why the Output is `"Alice is 30 years old and lives in Unknown"`**:  
   - The destructuring assignment retrieves the values of `name` and `age` directly from the `user` object.
   - Since `location` is missing from the `user` object, it takes on the default value of `"Unknown"`.
   - This prevents `location` from being `undefined` and provides a fallback value, making the code more robust.

Using default values in object destructuring allows us to handle incomplete data smoothly, ensuring variables have meaningful values even when some properties are missing.

##

## 4. **Skipping Array Elements**

In this step, we’ll explore how to **skip elements** in an array while destructuring, so you can selectively assign values to variables.

- [ ] Add the following code to `index.js` to see how array destructuring can skip elements:

```javascript
// Skipping Array Elements
const colors = ["red", "green", "blue", "yellow"];
const [first, , , last] = colors;
console.log(first, last); // Expected Output: red yellow
```

- [ ] Run your code using Node.js in the terminal:

```bash
node index.js
```

### Expected Output:

```bash
red yellow
```

### Explanation

This step demonstrates how to use commas in array destructuring to skip specific elements, allowing you to extract only the values you need.

**Skipping Unnecessary Elements**:  
   - The `colors` array contains four elements: `"red"`, `"green"`, `"blue"`, and `"yellow"`.
   - In the destructuring assignment, we only want the first and last colors. By placing empty commas `, ,` in the pattern, we skip over the second and third elements, `"green"` and `"blue"`, respectively.

**Why the Output is `"red yellow"`**:  
   - The variable `first` is assigned the first element of the array, `"red"`.
   - The empty commas `, ,` mean we skip `"green"` and `"blue"`, so `last` is assigned the fourth element, `"yellow"`.

This approach is useful when you want to extract specific values from an array without needing all elements, making the destructuring more selective and streamlined.

##

## 5. **Nested Object Destructuring**

In this step, we’ll explore how to use **nested object destructuring** to extract values from properties within nested objects.

- [ ] Add the following code to `index.js` to see how nested destructuring works:

```javascript
// Nested Object Destructuring
const book = {
     title: "JavaScript Guide",
     author: { name: "John Doe", country: "USA" },
     publisher: { name: "Tech Press", year: 2020 },
   };
   const {
     title,
     author: { name: authorName },
     publisher: { year },
   } = book;
   console.log(`${title} by ${authorName}, published in ${year}`);
   // Expected Output: "JavaScript Guide by John Doe, published in 2020"
```

- [ ] Run your code using Node.js in the terminal:

```bash
node index.js
```

### Expected Output:

```bash
JavaScript Guide by John Doe, published in 2020
```

### Explanation

This step demonstrates how to use nested destructuring to extract properties from within nested objects.

**Accessing Nested Properties Directly**:  
   - The `book` object has nested objects inside the `author` and `publisher` properties.
   - By using nested destructuring, we can directly access these properties and assign them to variables:
     - `title` is taken directly from `book`.
     - `{ name: authorName }` within `author` allows us to rename `name` to `authorName`.
     - `{ year }` within `publisher` extracts `year` directly.

**Why the Output is `"JavaScript Guide by John Doe, published in 2020"`**:  
   - `title` gets the value `"JavaScript Guide"`.
   - `authorName` is assigned `"John Doe"` from `author.name`.
   - `year` is assigned `2020` from `publisher.year`.

This approach to nested destructuring provides a concise way to retrieve values from nested objects, making the code more readable and reducing repetitive references to deeply nested properties.

##

## 6. **Function Parameter Destructuring with Defaults**

In this step, we’ll explore **function parameter destructuring** with default values, using an arrow function. This allows you to provide default values for properties when they are not provided in the function argument.

- [ ] Add the following code to `index.js` to see how function parameter destructuring with defaults works:

```javascript
// Function Parameter Destructuring with Defaults as Arrow Function
const configureSettings = ({ theme = "light", fontSize = "medium" } = {}) => {
 console.log(`Theme: ${theme}, Font Size: ${fontSize}`);
};
configureSettings({ theme: "dark" }); // Expected Output: Theme: dark, Font Size: medium
```

- [ ] Run your code using Node.js in the terminal:

```bash
node index.js
```

### Expected Output:

```bash
Theme: dark, Font Size: medium
```

### Explanation

This function demonstrates how to use **parameter destructuring with default values** in an arrow function, ensuring each parameter has a fallback value if not provided.

**How Default Values are Set**:  
   - In the `configureSettings` function, we destructure the `theme` and `fontSize` properties from an object parameter.
   - The destructuring pattern assigns `theme` a default value of `"light"` and `fontSize` a default of `"medium"`. If the function call omits these properties, these default values will be used instead.
   - The parameter itself is also set to default to an empty object (`{}`). This prevents errors if `configureSettings` is called without any arguments.

**Why the Output is `"Theme: dark, Font Size: medium"`**:  
   - The function call `configureSettings({ theme: "dark" })` provides only the `theme` property with the value `"dark"`.
   - Since no `fontSize` value is provided, the default value `"medium"` is applied.
   - The output shows `"Theme: dark, Font Size: medium"`, confirming that `theme` was set to `"dark"` while `fontSize` used its default value.

This technique is valuable for configuration functions where some settings are optional. By providing defaults in destructuring, the function can always rely on meaningful values for each property, even if some are missing.

## 7. **Destructuring with Rest Operator**

In this step, we’ll explore how to use the **rest operator (`...`)** with array destructuring to collect remaining elements into a new array.

- [ ] Add the following code to `index.js` to see how the rest operator works with array destructuring:

```javascript
// Destructuring with Rest Operator
const scores = [85, 90, 75, 88, 92];
const [firstScore, secondScore, ...remainingScores] = scores;
console.log(firstScore, secondScore); // Expected Output: 85 90
console.log(remainingScores); // Expected Output: [75, 88, 92]
```

- [ ] Run your code using Node.js in the terminal:

```bash
node index.js
```

### Expected Output:

```bash
85 90
[75, 88, 92]
```

### Explanation

This step demonstrates how to use the **rest operator (`...`)** with array destructuring to collect remaining elements into a new array.

**Using the Rest Operator**:  
   - The `scores` array contains five elements: `[85, 90, 75, 88, 92]`.
   - In the destructuring assignment, we assign the first two elements to `firstScore` and `secondScore`.
   - By including the rest operator `...remainingScores`, we capture all remaining elements of the array (`75`, `88`, `92`) into `remainingScores`.

**Why the Output is `85 90` and `[75, 88, 92]`**:  
   - `firstScore` and `secondScore` are assigned `85` and `90`, respectively, which are the first two values in the `scores` array.
   - The `remainingScores` variable is an array containing all elements that were not explicitly destructured, which are `[75, 88, 92]`.

The rest operator allows you to extract a subset of an array's elements while preserving the remainder in a new array. This technique is helpful when you only need certain values from the beginning of an array but want to store the remaining values for later use, making your code more flexible and readable.

##

## 8. **Real-World Application: User Profile System with Nested Destructuring and Default Values**

In this step, we’ll apply **nested destructuring** and **default values** to extract user information, handling cases where some data may be missing.

- [ ] Add the following code to `index.js` to see how nested destructuring and default values work with real-world data:

```javascript
// Real-World Application: User Profile System with Nested Destructuring and Default Values
const users = [
  { id: 1, profile: { name: "Alice", details: { age: 30, city: "New York" } } },
  { id: 2, profile: { name: "Bob", details: { age: 25 } } }, // Missing city to demonstrate default value
   ];

users.forEach(({ profile: { name, details: { age, city = "Location Unknown" } = {} } }) => {
 console.log(`${name} is ${age} years old and lives in ${city}`);
});
```

- [ ] Run your code using Node.js in the terminal:

```bash
node index.js
```

### Expected Output:

```bash
Alice is 30 years old and lives in New York
Bob is 25 years old and lives in Location Unknown
```

### Explanation

This code demonstrates how to use **nested destructuring with default values** to handle missing data within complex structures like a user profile system.

**Using Nested Destructuring with Default Values**:  
   - The `users` array contains objects where each user has a `profile` object, and within that, a nested `details` object.
   - In the destructuring pattern, we access `name` directly from `profile`, and `age` and `city` from `details`.
   - For `city`, a default value of `"Location Unknown"` is assigned within the destructuring pattern. This means that if `city` is missing, it will default to `"Location Unknown"`.
   - The entire `details` object is assigned a default value of `{}` to ensure the code doesn’t break if `details` itself is missing.

**Why the Output Shows `"Location Unknown"` for Missing Data**:  
   - For the first user (`Alice`), `name`, `age`, and `city` are all provided in `profile` and `details`, so they are destructured as expected, and `city` is set to `"New York"`.
   - For the second user (`Bob`), `city` is missing from the `details` object. Since `city` has a default value of `"Location Unknown"`, this value is used in place of `undefined`.

This use of nested destructuring with defaults allows us to handle cases where data may be incomplete, providing meaningful fallback values. This approach ensures that our application continues to function smoothly even with missing or optional data.
